                                <p>The Progress Pride Flag represents a shift towards inclusion that still speaks to the unique challenges of those with intersectional identities, but also affirms that progress and equity can only be actualized through unity.</p>
                                <p>The flag inspires me because it solidifies a sense of belonging for those of us who have been marginalized in and outside of the queer community, and there is an incredible power in belongingness that will continue to drive us forward.</p>
                                <p>As a queer, non-binary person, I am drawn to the color purple as a symbol of the female and male experiences in my identity and orientation. Also my headshot happened to be purple :)"</p>
